IDEA:
A platform to transfer text/links between multiple devices instantly. It uses a combnation of three platforms, namely a Web App, an Android App, and a Chrome Extension. Suppose some text is copied in the mobile, without even opening our app the text can be accessed instantly in our Web App and Chrome Extension. And any new text added from another device is copied to the clipboard by default and doesn't need to be copied manually again! 
It also supports the feature of Guest user to access the shared texts/links of a particular signed-in user using just a QR code. A signed-in user can share his QR code with his friends, who can scan the code and login into the session to access all the previously and currently shared texts.

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Web App-Bootstrap Framework,Firebase Realtime Database and Authentication,QR code API. Javascript,HTML & CSS
Android App-Firebase Realtime Database and Authentication,Glide,GSON Library,Android Design Library. Java , XML
Chrome Extension-Javascript, HTML & CSS

HOW TO RUN OUR APPLICATION:
Instructions-
1.Open the Web App and sign-in using your Gmail account. You can paste your text and access it in other synced devices. At the same time any new additions from other devices is directly copied to your clipboard and doesn't need to be manually copied, hence can directly be pasted wherever required.
2.Open the Android App and sign-in using your Gmail account. Whenever you copy any text in any other app or document, it is by defualt pasted to the android app and is dispalyed in realtime across other synced devices. At the same time any new additions from other devices is directly copied to your clipboard and doesn't need to be manually copied, hence can directly be pasted wherever required.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF APPLICATION:
The application solves the problem of instant sharing of text across multiple devices by providing a easy to use and light-weight application.

FUTURE SCOPE:
The application can be scaled up to be used for sharing all types of files/documents/etc instantly across devices and removing the current limitation of just sharing text. This can also be monetized if it is accepted by a large user base to provide premium features at a cost, in a similar way as Grammarly Extension works.
